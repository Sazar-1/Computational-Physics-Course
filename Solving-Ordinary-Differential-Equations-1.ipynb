    "## Key Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Order Reduction**: Always convert higher-order ODEs to first-order systems\n",
    "2. **Stiffness**: For stiff problems, use implicit methods (Backward Differentiation Formulas)\n",
    "3. **Boundary Conditions**: BVPs require different approaches (shooting, finite difference, spectral)\n",
    "4. **Accuracy**: Higher-order methods (RK4, spectral) generally provide better accuracy\n",
    "5. **Stability**: Implicit methods are more stable for stiff equations\n",

    "For production use, consider specialized libraries like:\n",
    "- `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` for initial value problems\n",
    "- `scipy.integrate.solve_bvp` for boundary value problems\n",
    "- `FEniCS` or `Firedrake` for finite element methods\n",
